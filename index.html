                Hello, I'm undfined. I find joy in translating ideas into world class <span class="highlight">user experiences.</span> I believe my superpower lies in unblocking the tough stuff,</span> filling in the gaps where others get stuck. I've lead a variety of 0 to 1 projects and <span class="highlight">relish opportunities</span> that push me outside of my comfort zone.

                      I've been a cofounder and Head of Product for Babylon.finance since we raised a $2MM seed round in February of 2020.
