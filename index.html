                        Built data pipelines processing multi-trillion token datasets for LLM pre-training. Constructed specialized data mixtures for two-stage curriculum training: large-scale corpora for primary pre-training and high-quality domain-specific datasets for late-stage patching. Developed data mixing strategies inspired by RegMix and DoReMi approaches, optimizing domain weights through proxy model experiments. Applied quality filtering using perplexity scoring, heuristic rules, and toxicity detection. Created curation pipelines for academic content, code, and synthetic instruction data. Optimized distributed processing with Ray.
